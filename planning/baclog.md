# Backlog

This backlog shows user stories for ABU's project. I organized these stories
inside 3 priorities level you are not necessarily in order.

## Must-Haves

As a novice user, I can navigate easily the home page.

- [x] _there is a navbar_
- [x] _there is a footer_
- [x] _there is a logo on top of the page_
- [x] _there is a paragraph explaining the purpose on the page_

As a web-development student, I may locate a variety of contacts on the home page, as well as a prospective digital entrepreneur. Consequently:

- I'll be able to work on open source projects with other students.
- I'll be able to contact coaches and experts for assistance.
- I'll be able to follow them on social media; - I'll be able to find relevant materials to help me improve my coding abilities.
- I discovered addresses for free online coding platforms.

As a web-development coach (mentor), I can see what a web-development student has learned so far. Consequently:

- I am capable of guiding and assisting the student.
- I am able to communicate with the student.
- Student's social media links are visible to me.
