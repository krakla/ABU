# Design

The design I offer is based on the several interviews I conducted. The goal
 of the design is to create a match between the needs of the users and the
  needs of the stakeholders. The stakeholder wishes to demonstrate her
   abilities, share knowledge, and network with students and experts in
    the field of digital technology.

I created an appealing, responsive, and easy-to-navigate homepage based on
 the information I gathered.

The navigation bar, logo, and body aren't cluttered. I didn't think the 
webpage needed a lot of pictures because the stakeholder wants to convey 
what she knows, her skills, and how she wants to build her network. 
I went with a simple design.
